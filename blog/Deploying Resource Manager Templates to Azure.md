## Deploying Resource Manager Templates to Azure

There are a number of ways in which you can deploy a template to Azure. You can do it through the Azure Portal ([https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)) or using API's that support .NET, Node.js or Python. For this series however, I will focus on the command line tools.

There are two sets of command line tools available for managing Azure. If you're on Windows, you can use the Azure PowerShell cmdlets. For Windows, Linux or macOS, there's the Azure Command Line Interface (Azure-CLI).
