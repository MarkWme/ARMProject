# The No Faff Guide to Azure Resource Manager

## Creating and Editing Templates with Visual Studio

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates are plain text files and can be created or edited in any text editor. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the best tool for template creation and editing. There are a lot of choices when it comes to text editors, but I like **Code** because it's quick and easy to install, it has a large and growing library of high quality extensions and it's under active development with new features and refinements being added every month. On top of that, Code works on Windows, macOS or Linux and it's [open source](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode).

Code isn't just a text editor, it's a development environment. Because of this, Code can help you create and edit your template, pointing out and helping you fix problems as you go.
